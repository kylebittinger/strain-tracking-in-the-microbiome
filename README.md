Assembly-based approaches

1. Review E. coli genome. Genome size, GC content, number of genes.
2. Tour of contigs and annotation files. Contig length (.fna), gene location on contigs (inference.tsv), gene annotations (.ffn).
3. Taxonomic annotation of contigs (Kraken assignment file). Look at species from 1d and 1m samples.
4. Use vsearch to align ORFs between samples.
